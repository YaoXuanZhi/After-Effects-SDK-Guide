## Entry Point

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
For all effect plug-ins, the entry point function (the name of which is specified in the PiPL) must have the following signature:

```c++
PF_Err main (
    PF_Cmd         cmd,
    PF_InData      *in_data,
    PF_OutData     *out_data,
    PF_ParamDef    *params[],
    PF_LayerDef    *output,
    void           *extra)
```

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Before each call to an effect’s entry point, After Effects updates `PF_InData` and the plug-in’s parameter array (except as noted). After the plug-in returns from its call, After Effects checks `PF_OutData` for changes and, when appropriate, uses the output the effect has rendered.

### Table 3: Effect Plug-in Entry Point

| **Argument** | **Purpose** |
| :--- | :--- |
|**cmd**|After Effects uses the command selector to tell the plug-in what to do.|
|**in_data**|Information about the application’s state and the data the plug-in is being told to act upon. Pointers to numerous interface and image manipulation functions are also provided.|
|**out_data**|Pass back information to After Effects by setting fields within `out_data`.|
|**params**|An array of the plug-in’s parameters at the time provided in `in_data>current_time.params[0]` is the input image (a `PF_EffectWorld`) to which the effect should be applied. These values are only valid during certain selectors (this is noted in the `selector descriptions`). Parameters are discussed at length `here`.|
|**output**|The output image, to be rendered by the effect plug-in and passed back to After Effects. Only valid during certain selectors.|
|**extra**|The extra parameter varies with the command sent or (in the case of `PF_Cmd_EVENT`) the event type. Used primarily for `event management` and `parameter supervision`.|
