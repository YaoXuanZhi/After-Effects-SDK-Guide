<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Commands are, simply, what After Effects wants your effect to do. Responses to some selectors are required; most are optional, though recall that we did add them for a reason...

### Table 4: Command selectors

#### Global Selectors
All plug-ins must respond to these selectors.

| **Selector** | **Response** |
| :--- | :--- |
|**PF_Cmd_ABOUT**|Display a dialog describing the plug-in. Populate `out_data>return_msg` and After Effects will display it in a simple modal dialog. Include your plug-in’s version information in the dialog. On Mac OS, the current resource file will be set to your effects module during this selector.|
|**PF_Cmd_GLOBAL_SETUP**|Set any required flags and `PF_OutData` fields (including `out_data>my_version`) to describe your plug-in’s behavior.|
|**PF_Cmd_GLOBAL_SETDOWN**|Free all global data (only required if you allocated some).|
|**PF_Cmd_PARAM_SETUP**|Describe your parameters and register them using `PF_ADD_PARAM`. Also, register custom user interface elements. Set `PF_OutData>num_params` to match your parameter count.|

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
#### Sequence Selectors
These control sequence data handling.

| **Selector** | **Response** |
| :--- | :--- |
|**PF_Cmd_SEQUENCE_SETUP**|Allocate and initialize any sequence-specific data. Sent when the effect is first applied. `PF_InData` is initialized at this time.|
|**PF_Cmd_SEQUENCE_RESETUP**|Re-create (usually unflatten) sequence data. Sent after sequence data is read from disk, during pre-composition, or when the effect is copied; After Effects flattens sequence data before duplication.During duplication, `PF_Cmd_SEQUENCE_RESETUP` is sent for both the old and new sequences. Don’t expect a `PF_Cmd_SEQUENCE_FLATTEN` between `PF_Cmd_SEQUENCE_RESETUP`s.|
|**PF_Cmd_SEQUENCE_FLATTEN**|Sent when saving and when duplicating the sequence. Flatten sequence data containing pointers or handles so it can be written to disk. Free the unflat data and set the `out_data>sequence_data` to point to the new flattened data. Flat data must be correctly byte-ordered for file storage.<br>As of 6.0, if an effect’s sequence data has recently been flattened, the effect may be deleted without receiving an additional
<br> `PF_Cmd_SEQUENCE_SETDOWN`. In this case, After Effects will dispose of your flat sequence data.|
|**PF_Cmd_SEQUENCE_SETDOWN**|`Free all sequence data.`|

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
#### Frame Selectors
Passed for each frame (or audio blip) to be rendered by your plug-in.

| **Selector** | **Response** |
| :--- | :--- |
|**PF_Cmd_FRAME_SETUP**|Allocate any frame-specific data. This is sent immediately before each frame is rendered, to allow for frame-specific setup data.<br><br>If your effect changes the size of its output buffer, specify the new output height, width, and relative origin. All parameters except the input layer are valid.If you set width and height to 0, After Effects ignores your response to the following `PF_Cmd_RENDER`.<br><br>NOTE: If `PF_Outflag_I_EXPAND_BUFFER` is set, you will receive this selector (and `PF_Cmd_FRAME_SETDOWN`) twice, once without `PF_Cmd_RENDER` between them. This is so we know whether or not the given layer will be visible.<br>Frame data dates from the days when machines might have 8MB of RAM. Given the calling sequence (above), it’s much more efficient to just allocate during `PF_Cmd_RENDER`.|
|**PF_Cmd_RENDER**|Populate output with effect-ed data. All fields in PF_InData are valid. If your response to this selector is interrupted (your calls to `PF_ABORT` or `PF_PROGRESS` returns an error code), your results will not be used.You cannot delete `frame_data` during this selector; you must wait until `PF_Cmd_FRAME_SETDOWN`.|
|**PF_Cmd_FRAME_SETDOWN**|Free any frame data allocated during `PF_Cmd_FRAME_SETUP`.|
|**PF_Cmd_AUDIO_SETUP**|Sent before every audio render. Request a time span of input audio. Allocate and initialize any sequence-specific data. If your effect requires input from a time span other than the output time span, update the `startsampL` and `endsampL` field in `PF_OutData`.|
|**PF_Cmd_AUDIO_RENDER**|Populate `PF_OutData.dest_snd` with effect-ed audio. All fields in `PF_InData` are valid. If your response to this selector is interrupted (your calls to `PF_ABORT` or `PF_PROGRESS` returns an error code), your results will not be used.|
|**PF_Cmd_AUDIO_SETDOWN**|Free memory allocated during `PF_Cmd_AUDIO_SETUP`.|
|**PF_Cmd_SMART_PRE_RENDER**|SmartFX only. Identify the area(s) of input the effect will need to produce its output, based on whatever criteria the effect implements.|
|**PF_Cmd_SMART_RENDER**|SmartFX only. Perform rendering and provide output for the area(s) the effect was asked to render.|

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
#### Messaging
The communication channel between After Effects and your plug-in.

| **Selector** | **Response** |
| :--- | :--- |
|**PF_Cmd_EVENT**|This selector makes use of the extra parameter; the type of event to be handled is indicated by the event_type field, a member of the structure pointed to by extra. See `UI`.|
|**PF_Cmd_USER_CHANGED_PARAM**|The user changed a parameter value. You will receive this command only if you’ve set the `PF_ParamFlag_SUPERVISE` flag. You modify the parameter to control values, or make one parameter’s value affect others. A parameter can be modified by different actions.|
|**PF_Cmd_UPDATE_PARAMS_UI**|The effect controls palette (ECP) needs to be updated. This might occur after opening the ECP or moving to a new time within the composition. You can modify parameter characteristics (enabling or disabling them, for example) by calling `PF_UpdateParamUI()`.<br><br>Only cosmetic changes may be made in response to this command. Don’t change parameter values while responding to PF_Cmd_UPDATE_PARAMS_UI; do so during `PF_Cmd_USER_CHANGED_PARAM` instead.<br><br>This command will only be sent regularly if `PF_OutFlag_SEND_UPDATE_PARAMS_UI` was set in the PiPL, and during `PF_Cmd_GLOBAL_SETUP`.<br><br>NOTE: Never check out parameters during this selector. Recursive badness is almost guaranteed to result.|
|**PF_Cmd_DO_DIALOG**|Display an options dialog. this is sent when the Options button is clicked (or a menu command has been selected). This selector will only be sent if the effect has previously indicated that it has a dialog (by setting the global `PF_OutFlag_I_DO_DIALOG` flag in response to `PF_Cmd_GLOBAL_SETUP`). in version 3.x, the params passed with `PF_Cmd_DO_DIALOG` were invalid. This is no longer the case; plug-ins can access non-layer parameters, check out parameters at other times, and perform UI updates during `PF_Cmd_DO_DIALOG`.They still may not change the parameter’s values.|
|**PF_Cmd_ARBITRARY_CALLBACK**|Manage your arbitrary data type. You’ll only receive this if you’ve registered a custom data type parameter. The extra parameter indicates which handler function is being called. Custom data types are discussed further in Implementation.|
|**PF_Cmd_GET_EXTERNAL_DEPENDENCIES**|Only sent if `PF_OutFlag_I_HAVE_EXTERNAL_DEPENDENCIES` was set during `PF_Cmd_GLOBAL_SETUP`. Populate a string handle (in the `PF_ExtDependenciesExtra` pointed to by extra) with a description of your plug-in’s dependencies, making sure to allocate space for the terminating NULL character. Return just a null character (‘\0’) if there are no dependencies to report.<br><br>If the check type is `PF_DepCheckType_ALL_DEPENDENCIES`, report everything that might be required for your plug-in to render. Report only missing items (or a null string if nothing’s missing) if the check type is `PF_DepCheckType_MISSING_DEPENDENCIES`.|
|**PF_Cmd_COMPLETELY_GENERAL**|Respond to an AEGP. The extra parameter points to whatever parameter the AEGP sent.AEGPs can only communicate with effects which respond to this selector.|
|**PF_Cmd_QUERY_DYNAMIC_FLAGS**|New in 5.0. Sent only to plug-ins which have specified `PF_OutFlag2_SUPPORTS_QUERY_DYNAMIC_FLAGS` in `PF_OutFlags2`, in their PiPL and during `PF_Cmd_GLOBAL_SETUP`. This selector will be sent at arbitrary times. In response, the effect accesses its (non-layer) parameters, and determines whether or not the following outflags and outflag2s need to be set <br><br>`PF_OutFlag_WIDE_TIME_INPUT`<br>`PF_OutFlag_NON_PARAM_VARY`<br>`PF_OutFlag_I_USE_SHUTTER_ANGLE`<br>`PF_OutFlag2_I_USE_3D_CAMERA`<br>`PF_OutFlag2_I_USE_3D_LIGHTS`<br>`PF_OutFlag2_REVEALS_ZERO_ALPHA` <br><br>After Effects uses this information for caching and optimization purposes, so try to respond as quickly as possible.|

### Response to selectors
With each command selector, effects receive information from After Effects in `PF_InData`, input and parameter values in params (an array of parameter descriptions including the input layer). They send information back to After Effects in PF_OutData, and (when appropriate) render output to a `PF_LayerDef`, also called a `PF_EffectWorld`. During events, they receive event-specific information in extra.

All the information provided by After Effects, combined with the provided callbacks and function suites, combine to make the effects API very powerful and flexible.

### Calling sequence
Only the first few command selectors are predictable; the rest of the calling sequence is dictated by user action.

When first applied, a plug-in receives `PF_Cmd_GLOBAL_SETUP`, then `PF_Cmd_PARAM_SETUP`. Each time the user adds the effect to a layer, `PF_Cmd_SEQUENCE_SETUP` is sent.

For each frame rendered by a non-SmartFX effect, After Effects sends `PF_Cmd_FRAME_SETUP`, then `PF_Cmd_RENDER`, then `PF_Cmd_FRAME_SETDOWN`. All effect plug-ins must respond to `PF_Cmd_RENDER`. For SmartFX, `PF_Cmd_SMART_PRE_RENDER` may be sent any number of times, before a single `PF_Cmd_SMART_RENDER` is sent.

`PF_Cmd_SEQUENCE_SETDOWN` is sent on exit, when the user removes an effect or closes the project. `PF_Cmd_SEQUENCE_RESETUP` is sent when a project is loaded or when the layer to which it’s applied changes. `PF_Cmd_SEQUENCE_FLATTEN` is sent when the After Effects project is written out to disk, but only if `PF_OutFlag_SEQUENCE_DATA_NEEDS_FLATTENING` was set during `PF_Cmd_GLOBAL_SETUP`.

`PF_Cmd_ABOUT` is sent when the user chooses About… from the effect controls palette (ECP).

`PF_Cmd_GLOBAL_SETDOWN` is sent when After Effects closes, or when the last instance of the effect is removed. Do not rely on this message to determine when your plug-in is being removed from memory; use OS-specific entry points.

### What's the difference?
There is a subtle difference between `PF_Cmd_USER_CHANGED_PARAM` and `PF_Cmd_UPDATE_PARAMS_UI`. Effects need to distinguish between the user actually changing a parameter value (`PF_Cmd_USER_CHANGED_PARAM`), and just scrubbing around the timeline (`PF_Cmd_UPDATE_PARAMS_UI`, which is also sent when the plug-in is first loaded).
