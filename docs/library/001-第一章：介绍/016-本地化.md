## Localization

Thanks to the new Unicode support in CS4, localization is much less painful. For non-Unicode strings, such as in older function suites, we expect strings to be multi-byte encoded using the application's current locale. On Windows, you can use the *WideCharToMultiByte()* function, specifying *CP_OEMCP* as the first argument. On Mac OS, use the encoding returned by *GetApplicationTextEncoding()*.
