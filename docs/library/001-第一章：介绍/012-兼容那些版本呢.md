## Compatibility across multiple versions?

You should test your plug-in thoroughly in each version of After Effects supported by your plug-in. If you need to add a conditional block of code to be run only in specific versions of After Effects, you can always check the API version in PF_InData>version. If you don’t update your project’s PiPL to request new versions, new API features will not be available to your plug-in.

### Effect API Versions
