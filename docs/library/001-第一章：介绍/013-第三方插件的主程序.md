Some developers are wary of using each After Effects release’s new API features, to maintain compatibility with hosts with partial implementations. You can distinguish between host applications by checking PF_InData>appl_id. After Effects uses the appl_id ‘FXTC’. Premiere Pro uses ‘PrMr’. As of this writing, no third party hosts support SmartFX, or our AEGP functions. Also, see the chapter on compatibility with Premiere Pro and other hosts.
